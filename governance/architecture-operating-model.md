🏛️ Architecture Operating Model
A practical, scalable operating model that defines how architecture engages with teams, how decisions are made, and how governance is applied without slowing delivery.

📘 1. Introduction
The Architecture Operating Model ensures that architectural decisions are:

Aligned with business strategy

Consistent across domains

Scalable as the enterprise grows

Empowering for product and engineering teams

Measured through clear KPIs

This model balances governance with team autonomy, enabling fast, high‑quality delivery across the enterprise.

🧭 2. Engagement Model
Architecture engages with teams through three modes:

Strategic Engagement (Quarterly)

Update capability models

Align with business strategy

Prioritize platform investments

Program Engagement (Monthly)
Support major initiatives

Provide reference architectures

Validate integration patterns

Ensure cross‑domain alignment

Team Engagement (On Demand)
Lightweight design reviews

Performance and resiliency patterns

This model ensures architecture is proactive, not reactive.
