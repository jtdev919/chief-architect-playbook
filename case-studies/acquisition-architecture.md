# M&A Architecture Integration (Case Study Template)

## Objective
Enable rapid acquisition integration without disrupting customers or compromising compliance.

## Due Diligence Approach
- Application portfolio inventory
- Data classification and compliance review
- Identity and access model assessment
- Integration and API surface review
- Operational maturity assessment (monitoring, incident response)

## Integration Strategy Options
1. **Absorb**
   - Migrate acquired capabilities into existing platforms

2. **Co-exist**
   - Maintain temporarily with strict boundaries and integration contracts

3. **Stand-alone**
   - Rare; only when divestiture/independent operation is required

## Common Controls
- Contract-first integration (APIs/events)
- Canonical mapping where duplication is unavoidable
- Centralized observability and correlation IDs
- Security posture standardization

## Success Metrics
- Time to integrate core business flows
- Customer churn impact
- Reduced duplicated systems
- Measurable reduction in operational complexity
