# 👥 Team Building & Talent Development
### Developing High‑Performing Architecture, Engineering, and Cross‑Functional Teams

Building strong teams is a core part of Enterprise Architecture leadership. Across multiple organizations, I have recruited, mentored, and developed architects, engineers, and cross‑functional contributors while establishing the structures, standards, and culture required for long‑term success.

---

## 🧭 Leadership Philosophy
My approach to team building centers on:

- **Raising the talent bar** through intentional hiring and mentorship  
- **Creating clarity** via standards, governance, and architectural runway  
- **Developing future leaders** through coaching, pairing, and Communities of Practice  
- **Empowering teams** with reusable patterns, starter projects, and reference implementations  
- **Ensuring alignment** across business, engineering, and product organizations  

This combination enables teams to deliver consistently, grow professionally, and operate with autonomy.

## 🧱 1. Building and Scaling High‑Performing Teams

### Highlights
- Directed IT and engineering organizations of **200+ staff** with a **$25M budget**, scaling from startup to $300M enterprise.  
- Managed distributed teams across the **US, Ukraine, and India**, ensuring cohesion, communication, and delivery consistency.  
- Recruited, hired, and mentored architects, engineers, and technical leads, raising capability and establishing a strong architectural culture.  
- Built and led **Communities of Practice (10–15 architects)** to drive shared learning, pattern adoption, and cross‑team alignment.  
- Served as **final decision authority** on architecture direction while empowering teams to innovate within guardrails.
