# Build vs Buy Guidelines

## Objective
Make durable investment decisions that maximize product velocity while minimizing long-term operational burden.

## Evaluate Across 6 Dimensions
1. **Differentiation**
   - Does this capability differentiate the business/product?
   - If yes → bias to build or deeply customize.
2. **Time-to-Value**
   - Can buy achieve acceptable value faster?
3. **Total Cost of Ownership**
   - Licensing + implementation + operations + upgrades + talent availability
4. **Risk & Compliance**
   - Data classification, auditability, regulatory constraints
5. **Integration Complexity**
   - APIs, events, data model compatibility, lifecycle management
6. **Strategic Control**
   - Roadmap dependency, vendor lock-in, extensibility

## Common Outcomes
- **Buy** when capability is commodity and vendor is mature.
- **Build** when capability is differentiating or needs deep workflow control.
- **Hybrid** when core is bought but business logic/experience is built.

## Required Artifacts
- One-page decision summary
- Architecture diagram (current and target)
- Risk register (top 5 risks + mitigations)

## Decision Ownership
- Business sponsor + Chief Architect + Engineering leadership
