# 🏛️ Architecture Operating Model

A practical, scalable operating model that defines how architecture engages with teams, how decisions are made, and how governance is applied without slowing delivery.

---

## 📘 1. Introduction

The Architecture Operating Model ensures that architectural decisions are:

- **Aligned** with business strategy  
- **Consistent** across domains  
- **Scalable** as the enterprise grows  
- **Empowering** for product and engineering teams  
- **Measured** through clear KPIs  

This model balances governance with team autonomy, enabling fast, high‑quality delivery across the enterprise.

## 🧭 2. Engagement Model

Architecture engages with teams through three modes:

### **Strategic Engagement (Quarterly)**
- Define and refine the North Star Architecture  
- Update capability models  
- Align with business strategy  
- Prioritize platform investments  

### **Program Engagement (Monthly)**
- Support major initiatives  
- Provide reference architectures  
- Validate integration patterns  
- Ensure cross‑domain alignment  

### **Team Engagement (On Demand)**
- Lightweight design reviews  
- API and event schema guidance  
- Cloud architecture support  
- Performance and resiliency patterns  

This model ensures architecture is proactive, not reactive.
