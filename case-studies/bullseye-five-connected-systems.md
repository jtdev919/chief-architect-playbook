# BullsEye Telecom — Five Connected Enterprise Systems

## Context
BullsEye Telecom required an integrated enterprise platform to manage profitability,
pricing, contracts, billing, and customer insight across hundreds of enterprise customers
and thousands of locations.

## Architectural Approach
The platform was designed as five independently evolvable systems connected through:
- Canonical data models
- Shared integration services
- Event-driven workflows

## The Five Systems
1. **Customer Profitability System**  
   Margin visibility at enterprise, customer, and location levels.

2. **Contract Management System**  
   Pricing terms, approvals, DocuSign workflows, and auditability.

3. **Automated Price Adjustment Engine**  
   Tariff-driven pricing automation with what-if modeling and rollback.

4. **Data Warehouse & BI Platform**  
   Snowflake-based analytics with Tableau executive dashboards.

5. **Customer Cost Management Portal**  
   Client-facing transparency driving retention and differentiation.

## Outcome
Together these systems became the economic backbone of the company and were cited
as a **primary driver in BullsEye Telecom’s acquisition**.
