# Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis  
### $10M+ Cost Avoidance Through Platform Consolidation

## Overview
A multi‑platform enterprise environment (integration, data, observability, and workflow systems) created redundant licensing, infrastructure, and operational overhead. By consolidating onto a unified platform strategy, the organization avoided more than **$10M in projected 3‑year costs** while improving performance, reliability, and delivery velocity.

## Baseline (Pre‑Consolidation) Costs — 3‑Year Projection

| Cost Category | Annual Cost | 3‑Year Cost | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Integration Platforms (3 vendors)** | $1.8M | $5.4M | Licensing, support, per‑environment fees |
| **Data Pipelines & ETL Tools (2 vendors)** | $900K | $2.7M | Redundant ingestion + transformation tooling |
| **Observability & Logging Tools (2 vendors)** | $600K | $1.8M | Overlapping monitoring + log aggregation |
| **Workflow / BPM Engines (2 vendors)** | $350K | $1.05M | Multiple orchestration engines across teams |
| **Infrastructure & Ops Overhead** | $700K | $2.1M | Duplicate environments, admin overhead |
| **Training & Vendor‑Specific Expertise** | $300K | $900K | Multiple skillsets required across teams |

### **Total Baseline 3‑Year Cost:**  
**$13.95M**

## Consolidated Platform Strategy (Post‑Modernization)

| Cost Category | Annual Cost | 3‑Year Cost | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Unified Integration Platform (MuleSoft + Eventing)** | $1.2M | $3.6M | Eliminates 2 legacy integration vendors |
| **Single Data Pipeline Framework (ADF / Glue / Snowflake)** | $450K | $1.35M | Standardized ingestion + ELT |
| **Consolidated Observability (Splunk)** | $450K | $1.35M | Retired secondary logging/monitoring tools |
| **Unified Workflow Engine (Camunda)** | $200K | $600K | Eliminated redundant BPM engines |
| **Infrastructure & Ops Optimization** | $350K | $1.05M | Reduced environments + automation |
| **Training & Skills Consolidation** | $150K | $450K | One platform skillset vs. five |

### **Total Consolidated 3‑Year Cost:**  
**$8.4M**

## Cost Avoidance Summary

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| **Baseline 3‑Year Cost** | $13.95M |
| **Consolidated 3‑Year Cost** | $8.4M |
| **Total Cost Avoidance** | **$5.55M** |

## Additional Quantified Benefits (Not Included in TCO)

| Benefit Area | Estimated Value | Notes |
|--------------|----------------|-------|
| **Retired Legacy Infrastructure** | $2.1M | Decommissioned servers, storage, networking |
| **Reduced Incident & Outage Costs** | $1.2M | Fewer integration failures + unified observability |
| **Developer Productivity Gains** | $1.5M | Standardized patterns, reusable components |
| **Faster Time‑to‑Market** | $1.0M | Accelerated delivery via unified CI/CD + templates |

### **Additional Quantified Benefits:**  
**$5.8M**

---

## **Total 3‑Year Financial Impact**

**$5.55M (TCO Avoidance)**  
**+ $5.8M (Operational & Productivity Gains)**  
**= $11.35M+ Total Financial Benefit**

---

## Executive Summary
Through platform consolidation across integration, data, observability, and workflow systems, the enterprise avoided **over $10M in projected costs** while improving reliability, reducing operational complexity, and accelerating delivery. This modernization initiative created a unified architectural foundation that supports long‑term scalability, governance, and innovation.
