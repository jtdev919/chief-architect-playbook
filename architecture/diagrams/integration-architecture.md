# Integration Architecture — API‑Led + Event‑Driven This document describes the enterprise integration architecture using an API‑led approach combined with an event‑driven backbone. It ensures loose coupling, scalability, and consistent integration patterns across domains and systems. --- ## 🧭 Overview The integration architecture is built on two complementary pillars: ### **1. API‑Led Architecture** A layered API model that separates: - **Experience APIs** — channel‑specific interfaces - **Process APIs** — orchestration and business workflows - **System APIs** — stable interfaces to core systems ### **2. Event‑Driven Architecture** A real‑time event backbone enabling: - Asynchronous communication - Choreography of distributed workflows - High scalability and resilience --- ## 🏗️ API‑Led Integration Diagram ```mermaid flowchart LR A[Experience API Layer] --> B[Process API Layer] B --> C[System API - CRM] B --> D[System API - ERP] B --> E[System API - Payments] B --> F[System API - Inventory]
