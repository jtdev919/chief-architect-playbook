# Architectural Decision Framework

Every architectural decision is evaluated across:

1. **Business Impact** — revenue, cost, customer experience
2. **Operational Risk** — availability, recovery, complexity
3. **Scalability** — growth, load, organizational scale
4. **Security & Compliance** — regulatory and data risk
5. **Delivery Velocity** — enablement vs friction

Decisions are documented, reversible when possible, and revisited only when assumptions change.
