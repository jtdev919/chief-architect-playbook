# Chief Architect Playbook

This repository demonstrates how I operate as a **Chief Architect** responsible for
enterprise-wide architecture strategy, governance, and long-term platform direction.

The focus is on:
- Architectural decision-making
- Governance models
- Platform strategy
- Executive alignment
- M&A architecture integration

This is intentionally **not a code repository**.  
It represents architecture as an operating discipline.
